# Ring Election Algorithm Simulation

This is a simulation of the ring leader election algorithm in a distributed system.

## How to run as simple console application

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `Main.java` in the src folder to start the simulation
3. The simulation will run until the leader is elected
4. The simulation will print the current state of the system to the console
5. The clear output will be in generated separate files for each node process
6. Enter 1 in console to destroy all processes and exit the simulation
7. Killing the current coordinator not implemented yet
